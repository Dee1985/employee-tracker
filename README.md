Challenges:

- Joining the different databases to make a cohesive view was challenging.
- The employee managers are able to be viewed but not in it's own category.

The app is functional!

Roadmap: Attempting bonus tasks of removing employees, departments and roles. Did not include fuction to total salary of departments.
